# .emacs.d - Enhanced Fork

An enhanced Emacs configuration for modern Clojure SaaS development with AI integration, forked from [magnars/emacsd-reboot](https://github.com/magnars/emacsd-reboot).

**Original Philosophy**: A personal Emacs configuration as seen on emacsrocks.com and parens-of-the-dead.com, optimized for Norwegian keyboard on OSX.

**This Fork**: Extends the original foundation with AI-enhanced workflows, development process management, and modern SaaS tooling while preserving the personal, pragmatic approach.

## Installation

Download [Emacs for Mac OSX](http://emacsformacosx.com/).

```bash
# Backup your existing configuration
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup

# Clone this enhanced fork
git clone <your-fork-url> ~/.emacs.d

# Start Emacs
emacs
```

### AI Integration Setup (Fork Addition)

For AI features, create `~/.emacs.d/private.el`:

```elisp
(setq my/secret-openai-key "your-openai-key"
      my/secret-anthropic-key "your-anthropic-key"
      my/secret-google-gemini-api-key "your-gemini-key"
      my/secret-deepseek-api-key "your-deepseek-key")
```

## Out of band dependencies

### Original Dependencies

- Spell checking:
    ```
    brew install aspell --lang=en
    ```

- Static analysis for Clojure with LSP:
    ```
    brew install clojure-lsp/brew/clojure-lsp-native
    ```

- Fast grepping:
    ```
    brew install ripgrep
    ```

- Make dired happy, install `gls` as replacement for `ls`:
    ```
    brew install xz coreutils
    ```

- Stop clojure-lsp from adding duplicate namespace declarations:
    Open `~/.config/clojure-lsp/config.edn` and add:
    ```
    {:auto-add-ns-to-new-files? false}
    ```

- Add dependencies to the project without CIDER running:
    ```
    brew install babashka/brew/neil
    ```

- Static analysis for CSS with LSP:
    ```
    npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted
    ```

- On a Mac you might want to do this, to disable `C-M-d` in your OS:
    ```
    defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 70 '<dict><key>enabled</key><false/></dict>'
    ```

### Fork Additions - SaaS Development Stack

- **Datomic Pro** (for ShipClojure-Datom development):
    ```bash
    # Download from https://my.datomic.com/downloads/pro
    # Extract and add to PATH
    ```

- **Node.js and npm** (for Shadow-CLJS and CSS builds):
    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```

- **AI Integration Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # For MCP filesystem server
    npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
    
    # For MCP fetch server  
    pip install mcp-server-fetch
    # or with uvx: uvx mcp-server-fetch
    ```

## Tips for using these emacs settings

### Original Guidance (Still Applies)

If you want to use my settings straight out of the box, here are some things to note:

* This is my personal emacs configuration. I am constantly tuning it to my preferences. You should consider doing the same. Maybe start with a blank emacs + [Technomancy's better-defaults package](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults), and then dig through this repo for useful nuggets, instead of forking it directly.

* The key bindings are optimized for a norwegian keyboard layout.

* You quit emacs with `C-x r q`, mnemonic *Really Quit*.

* Find file in project with `C-x p f`, in dir with `C-x C-f`, recent with `C-x f`

* Switch to a project with `C-x p p`

* Add your user- and project-specific stuff in .emacs.d/users/[machine name]/*.el

* `C-h` is rebound to backspace, like in the shell. Get help on `F1` instead.

* Autocomplete with `C-,` or `C-.`, try both to get a feel for them. (autocomplete entire lines with `C-:`)

* expand-region is your friend. Find its bound key by doing `F1 f er/expand-region`

* Undo with `C-_` and redo with `M-_`. Watch the undo-tree with `C-x u`

* Indent and clean up white space in the entire buffer with `C-c n`

* On a mac, the Meta key `M` is bound to Command.

* I recommend rebinding Caps Lock to Ctrl and use that instead of the often badly placed Ctrl-key.

* Watch [emacsrocks.com](http://emacsrocks.com)

### Fork-Specific Tips

* **AI assistance**: `C-c RET` to send context to AI, `C-c C-RET` for provider menu
* **Process management**: `C-c C-x C-p` to manage development services (Datomic, Shadow-CLJS, etc.)
* **Continuous window resize**: `C-x }` then keep pressing `}` to continuously enlarge windows
* **Enhanced buffer operations**: `C-x C-r` to rename file and buffer, `C-x C-k` to delete file
* **Auto-testing**: Tests run automatically when you save Clojure files
* **Smart yanking**: Pasted code auto-indents in programming modes

## Enhanced Features (Fork Additions)

## Survival guide for the first week of emacs

When you start using emacs for the first time, your habits fight you every inch
of the way. Your fingers long for the good old familiar keybindings. Here's an
overview of the most commonly used shortcuts to get you through this pain:

* `C      ` Shorthand for the ctrl-key
* `M      ` Shorthand for the meta-key (bound to command on my mac settings)
* `S      ` Shorthand for the shift-key
* `s      ` Shorthand for the super-key (bound to option on my mac settings)

### Files

* `C-x C-f` Open a file. Starts in the current directory
* `C-x f  ` Open a recently visited file
* `C-x p f` Open a file in the current project (based on .git ++)
* `C-x C-s` Save this file
* `C-x C-w` Save as ...
* `C-x C-j` Jump to this files' current directory
* `C-x b  ` Switch to another open file (buffer)
* `C-x C-b` List all open files (buffers)

#### Enhanced File Operations (Fork)
* `C-x C-r` Rename current file and buffer
* `C-x C-k` Delete current file and kill buffer  
* `C-x M-w` Copy current file path to clipboard
* `C-x t  ` Touch file (save without changes)
* `C-c b  ` Create new scratch buffer

### Cut copy and paste

* `C-space` Start marking stuff. C-g to cancel.
* `C-w    ` Cut (aka kill)
* `C-k    ` Cut till end of line
* `M-w    ` Copy
* `C-y    ` Paste (aka yank) - **auto-indents in programming modes** (fork)
* `M-y    ` Cycle last paste through previous kills
* `C-x C-y` Choose what to paste from previous kills
* `C-@    ` Mark stuff quickly. Press multiple times
* `C-S-y  ` Paste without auto-indenting (fork)

### General

* `C-g    ` Quit out of whatever mess you've gotten yourself into
* `M-x    ` Run a command by name
* `C-.    ` Autocomplete
* `C-_    ` Undo
* `M-_    ` Redo
* `C-x u  ` Show the undo-tree
* `C-x m  ` Open magit. It's a magical git interface for emacs

#### AI and Process Management (Fork)

* `C-e    ` Go to end of line
* `M-g M-g` Go to line number
* `C-x C-i` Go to symbol
* `C-s    ` Search forward. Press `C-s` again to go further.
* `C-r    ` Search backward. Press `C-r` again to go further.

### Window management

* `C-x 1  ` Close other windows
* `C-x 2  ` Split window horizontally
* `C-x 3  ` Split window vertically
* `S-arrow` Jump to window to the left/right/up/down

#### Enhanced Window Operations (Fork)
* `C-x }  ` Enlarge window horizontally, then `}}}...` to keep enlarging
* `C-x {  ` Shrink window horizontally, then `{{{...` to keep shrinking
* `C-x ^  ` Enlarge window vertically, then `^^^...` to keep enlarging
* `C-`    ` Toggle popup buffers (REPLs, help, etc.)

### Testing (Fork Addition)
